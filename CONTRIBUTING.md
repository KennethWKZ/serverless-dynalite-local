# Contrbuting

Welcome as a contributor to `serverless-dynalite-local`. Since the project is
fairly new, and we stricly don't know it will lift off, we will discuss
contributions on a case by case basis.

What's important to us, no matter what, is that we get feedback on how it works,
and how it doesn't. We would love to hear from you no matter what experience
you have with the library. Please open an issue in GitHub if you have any
feedback.

Below you'll find instructions on how to get your hands dirty in case you want
to start hacking on this library.

## Hacking

```sh
yarn

Build:

```sh

```

Watch:

```

Run the tests:
